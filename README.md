Stephen's Scripts Directory

Installed at `~/.bin`.
On my `$PATH`.
A collection of random scripts.

Scripts included:

* gitlogger.rb from [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com).
(Please see [Scatterbrains: git as biographer](http://brettterpstra.com/scatterbrains-git-as-biographer/) and
[Git logger revisited](http://brettterpstra.com/git-logger-revisited/) for more information).
I've made a slight modification to put the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
* gitlogger_yesterday.rb is a modification of the same script to log all git commits from the past day.
This is useful in case the program doesn't run the day before.
